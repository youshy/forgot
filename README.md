# Forgot

A simple package to help with NOT forgetting stuff. Currently tailored only for `*.md` files.

## How does it work?

For now, you can do three moves:

* `help` - if you forget what to do
* `what` - prints out all the files you might forget
* `<filename>` - when you use `what` to recall which file you forgot, you can use the `<filename>` to print it to the stdout

## How to set it up?

Add all notes to `forgot` directory which is in the same place as the binary* - and that's all!

> *this will be addressed with a small config file!
